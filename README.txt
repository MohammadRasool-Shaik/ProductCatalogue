I have worked on one of the firm's most awaited projects called Proactive. Which makes every application makes ever-green without application developer involvement. This project played a key-role right from scratch of the project. I have designed DB schema and technical design for the most important component (coordinator, rule-engine, and Reporting) service.The coordinator which takes the decision of the upgrade, the rule-engine applies the rules on the upgrade, and reporting service gives the reports of various aspects of an upgrade.I am taking the leadership for these services right from the beginning which does a crucial role in the life-cycle of the upgrade of an application.I have designed and integrated external messaging services like Kafka (GKS) right from the scratch, which does asynchronous calls from various services like Coordinator, Reports, and Collector-Event services.I have integrated the IDA service which provides Authentication and Authorization for the services. I have integrated all the applications into the proactive Eco-World.I have integrated Rest-template which can handle the IDA token life-cycle for most of the services.I have designed and integrated external services which support Observability right from the scratch. Which plays a pivotal role Observe all the services for production support.Services integrated to achieve Observability Micro-meter for instrumentation, Jager for tracing, Prometheus for time-series DB, and Grafna for visualization. I have taken complete ownership of the Observability and created dashboards in different environments.
